# Express.js API with Session-Based Authentication and Handlebars Template Engine

This project is a full-stack web application developed using Express.js and designed for RESTful API development and session-based user authentication. 
It demonstrates how to build a modern web application with secure authentication mechanisms, dynamic data handling, and server-side rendering.

# Key features include:

- RESTful API Development: The application exposes well-structured API endpoints that allow users to interact with resources, 
  such as creating, updating, deleting, and fetching data. These endpoints follow REST conventions, ensuring scalability and ease of integration with other services.

- Session-Based User Authentication: The project implements secure session-based authentication using express-session and stores session data in MongoDB (via connect-mongodb-session). 
  Users can register, log in, and maintain their authentication state across multiple requests.
  Sessions ensure a secure and seamless user experience across different parts of the application.

- Password Hashing with Bcrypt: User passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt library, 
  preventing plain-text storage of sensitive data. This enhances the security of user credentials and ensures compliance with best practices for password management.

- Data Validation and Sanitization: The application integrates express-validator to validate and sanitize user input for various forms, 
  including login and registration. This helps prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensures the integrity of the data being processed.

- Handlebars Templating: The project also utilizes the Handlebars template engine to render dynamic views on the server side. 
  By leveraging the power of Handlebars, the app is able to provide customized content to users, making it possible to render HTML views based on data fetched from the database.
